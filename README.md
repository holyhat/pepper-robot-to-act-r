This is a proof-of-concept for the integration of a cognitive architecture (ACT-R) with the humanoid social robot Pepper preparing a technical basis for a more human-like perception of human interaction partners.
The use of cognitive architectures is promising in order to achieve more human-like reactions and behavior in social robots. For example, ACT-R can be used to create a dynamic cognitive person model of a human cooperation partner of the robot. 
This code contains the application for the Pepper robot and an example ACT-R model pepper-mood.lsp in the act-r folder.
The ACT-R model is updated with dynamic data from emotion recognition by the robot.
