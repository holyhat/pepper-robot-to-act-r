This is a proof-of-concept for the integration of a cognitive architecture (ACT-R) with the humanoid social robot Pepper preparing a technical basis for a more human-like perception of human interaction partners.
The use of cognitive architectures is promising in order to achieve more human-like reactions and behavior in social robots. For example, ACT-R can be used to create a dynamic cognitive person model of a human cooperation partner of the robot. 
This code contains the application for the Pepper robot and an example ACT-R model pepper-mood.lsp in the act-r folder.
The ACT-R model is updated with dynamic data from emotion recognition by the robot.

The standalone version of ACT-R is intended for use here, i.e. the application provided at https://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/. To establish a remote connection from the robot to ACT-R, the remote interface – the *dispatcher* – has to be used, which is implemented by a central command server. The ACT-R core software connects to this dispatcher to provide access to its commands, and the dispatcher accepts TCP/IP socket connections that allow clients to access these commands and provide their own commands for use. 

By default, the standalone version of ACT-R forces the dispatcher to use the localhost IP address of the computer on which it is running for connections. This means that only programs on the same computer can establish a connection, and once ACT-R has been started, this can no longer be changed. To disable this function, the file *force-local.lisp* must be removed from the ACT- R/patches directory before ACT-R is executed. Then it will use the machine’s real IP address for the dispatcher’s connections and setting *allow-external-connections* in the model file will let other machines connect. Another option is to place the model file in the ACT-R/user-loads directory. External connections are then always permitted. The address and port used by the dispatcher is displayed at the top of the ACT-R terminal window. This information must be used on the remote computer or, in our case, in the Pepper application for the connection.
